# Go Enums and iota

Source: https://blog.learngoprogramming.com/golang-const-type-enums-iota-bc4befd096d3

[Enums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) are useful parts of many languages. Unfortunately, enums in Go aren't as useful due to Go's implementattion. The biggest drawback is that they arenâ€™t strictly typed, thus you have to manually validate them.

For example, suppose that you want to create `an enum of the weekdays`.

## The enums without iota

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Declare a new type named Weekday which will unify our enum values
// It has an underlying type of unsigned integer (uint).
type Weekday int

// Declare typed constants each with type of Weekday
const (
   Sunday    Weekday = 0
   Monday    Weekday = 1
   Tuesday   Weekday = 2
   Wednesday Weekday = 3
   Thursday  Weekday = 4
   Friday    Weekday = 5
   Saturday  Weekday = 6
)

// String returns the name of the day
func (day Weekday) String() string {
    names := [...]string{"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}

    if day < Sunday || day > Saturday {
      return "Unknown"
    }

    return names[day]
}

// Weekend return true for a weekend day
func (day Weekday) Weekend() bool {
    switch day {
    case Sunday, Saturday:
        return true
    default:
        return false
    }
}

func main() {
    // Which day it is? Sunday
    fmt.Printf("Which day it is? %s\n", Sunday)

    // Is Saturday a weekend day? true
    fmt.Printf("Is Saturday a weekend day? %t\n", Saturday.Weekend())

    // Is Monday a weekend day? false
    fmt.Printf("Is Monday a weekend day? %t\n", Monday.Weekend())
}
```

## The enums with iota

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Declare a new type named Weekday which will unify our enum values
// It has an underlying type of unsigned integer (uint).
type Weekday int

// Declare typed constants each with type of Weekday
const (
   Sunday    Weekday = iota
   Monday
   Tuesday
   Wednesday
   Thursday
   Friday
   Saturday
)

// String returns the name of the day
func (day Weekday) String() string {
    names := [...]string{"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}

    if day < Sunday || day > Saturday {
      return "Unknown"
    }

    return names[day]
}

// Weekend return true for a weekend day
func (day Weekday) Weekend() bool {
    switch day {
    case Sunday, Saturday:
        return true
    default:
        return false
    }
}

func main() {
    // Which day it is? Sunday
    fmt.Printf("Which day it is? %s\n", Sunday)

    // Is Saturday a weekend day? true
    fmt.Printf("Is Saturday a weekend day? %t\n", Saturday.Weekend())

    // Is Monday a weekend day? false
    fmt.Printf("Is Monday a weekend day? %t\n", Monday.Weekend())
}
```

### Iota basic

`iota` in short:

- A numeric universal counter starting at 0
- Used only with constant declarations.

iota increases by 1 after each line except empty and comment lines.

Don't use iota for a list of predefined values like [FTP server status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes).

### Iota expressions & rules

- Reset iota

```go
// iota reset: it will be 0.
const (
    Zero = iota  // Zero = 0
    One          // One = 1
)
// iota reset: will be 0 again
const (
    Two = iota   // Two = 0
)
// iota: reset
const Three = iota // Three = 0
```

- Skip some values

```go
type Timezone int

const (
    // iota: 0, EST: -5
    EST Timezone = -(5 + iota)
    // _ is the blank identifier
    // iota: 1
    _
    // iota: 2, MST: -7
MST
)
```

- One a comment or an empty line, iota will not increase

- Use iota in the middle

```go
const (
    One = 1
    Two = 2
    // Three = 2 + 1 => 3
    Three = iota + 1
)
```

- Multiple iotas in a single line

```go
const (
    // Active = 0, Moving = 0,
    // Running = 0
    Active, Moving, Running = iota, iota, iota
    // Passive = 1, Stopped = 1,
    // Stale = 1
    Passive, Stopped, Stale
)
```

- Repeat and cancel expressions

```go
const (
    // iota: 0, One: 1 (type: int64)
    One  int64  = iota + 1
    // iota: 1, Two: 2 (type: int64)
    // Two will be declared as if:
    // Two int64 = iota + 1
    Two
    // iota: 2, Four: 4 (type: int32)
    Four int32  = iota + 2
    // iota: 3, Five: 5 (type: int32)
    // Five will be declared as if:
    // Five int32 = iota + 2
    Five
    // (type: int)
    Six = 6
    // (type: int)
    // Seven will be declared as if:
    // Seven = 6
    Seven
)
```

- Produce alphabets

```go
const (
    // string will convert the
    // expression into string.
    //
    // or, it'll assign character
    // codes.
    a = string(iota + 'a') // a
    b                      // b
    c                      // c
    d                      // d
    e                      // e
)
```

- Beware the zero-value

```go
type Activity int
const (
    Sleeping = iota
    Walking
    Running
)
func main() {
    var activity Activity
    // activity initialized to
    // its zero-value of int
    // which is Sleeping
// iota + 1 trick
const (
    Sleeping = iota + 1
    Walking
    Running
)
func main() {
    var activity Activity
    // activity will be zero,
    // so it's not initialized
    activity = Sleeping
    // now you know that it's been
    // initialized
}
```
